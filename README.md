# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

# 👋 Hi, I'm Bharath Reddy

🚀 **AI/ML Engineer | 3+ YOE | GenAI • Computer Vision • NLP • MLOps**

I design and deploy intelligent systems that solve real-world problems at scale—across telecom, smart surveillance, and document AI domains. My focus spans from building multimodal GenAI agents to deploying vision + voice-based access control systems.  

Currently: **AI/ML Engineer at Frontier Communications (USA)**  
Previously: **Jr. Data Scientist at Teradata (India)**  
🎓 MS in Computer Science, Rivier University - Dec 2024 (USA)

### 🏗️ Projects & Deployments

💠 **Face Verification System** (Siamese + NAS)  
→ Real-time employee access control with precomputed embeddings and thresholded similarity scoring.

📸 **ALPR Edge System** (YOLOv8 + OCR)  
→ Smart-city license plate recognition with OCR confidence boosted by 35% using custom preprocessing.

🔍 **LLM-based Document QA** (RAG + T5 + LangChain)  
→ Question-answering over lengthy documents using FAISS, SBERT embeddings, and chunked summarization.

📦 **Retail Fraud & Churn Models** (XGBoost + PySpark)  
→ Built at Teradata on massive customer datasets with Optuna + Snowflake + Airflow deployment.

🧠 **Emotion-Aware Multimodal Assistant** *(Currently building)*  
→ Combining facial expression (YOLO + landmark detection), voice tone (MFCCs + CNNs), and LLMs to understand user sentiment and adapt responses in real time. Target use case: **mental health AI agents**.

🛰️ **Autonomous AI Agent with Memory** *(Upcoming)*  
→ Building an end-to-end AI assistant with LangChain + FAISS + OpenAI that has **long-term memory, reasoning abilities, and real-time internet search**. Goal: **a research copilot that thinks and learns like a teammate.**
